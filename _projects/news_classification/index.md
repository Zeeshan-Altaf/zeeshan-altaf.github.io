title: Multi-class news categorization by fine tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
description:  In this project I have created a tool to effectively categorize news articles given their headlines. Comparative analysis of DistilBERT, DistilBART, RoBERTa, and DistilGPT-2 revealed the superior perormance of DistilBART due to its higher number of learnable paramenters (~230 M). DistilBART achieved 66.3% with 42 labels of news article. Models performance were restricted due to dataset imbalance and overlapping categories. After merging overlapping categories, DistilBART achieved the accuracy of 71.0%. 
skills: 
  - Natural language processing
  - Large language models
  - Fine tuning
  - Data cleaning
  - Exploratory data analysis
  - Data visualization

{% include image-gallery.html images="_projects/news_classification/CRIME_headline.jpg" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
{% include youtube-video.html id="tGCdLEQzde0" autoplay = "false" width= "900px" %}

## Starting a new line
leave two spaces "  " at the end or enter <br>

## Adding bold text
this is how you input **bold text**

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

## Adding ordered list
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

## Adding unordered list
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

## Adding code block
```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
```

```python
def start()
  print("time to start!")
```

```javascript
let x = 1;
if (x === 1) {
  let x = 2;
  console.log(x);
}
console.log(x);

```

## Adding external links

## Adding block quote
> A blockquote would look great if you need to highlight something


## Adding table 

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 |
