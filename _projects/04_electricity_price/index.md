title: Forecasting electricity price of Australia using time series analysis
description: The demand for electricity and its associated costs plays a critical role in shaping national energy policy, business operations, and household economics. In this project, I focuses on applying predictive analytics techniques to historical electricity pricing data to forecast Australiaâ€™s average electricity prices through to the year 2050. The dataset, covering state-level electricity prices from 1998 to 2025, is used to analyze trends and derive forward-looking insights. Linear regression and ARIMA are implemented using R. Overall, ARIMA performed well as it incorporates both recent price changes and overall trend, making it more accurate for non-stationary time series forecasting. It predicts more realistic growth of above $200/MWh for year 2050.
